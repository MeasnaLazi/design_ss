/**
 * `design-ss editor` -- install, start and stop the strip editor without needing
 * to know where the toolkit was installed.
 *
 * Three verbs, and each does exactly one thing:
 *
 *   install   fetch the editor's dependencies (~200 MB, once, into the toolkit)
 *   start     spawn it in the background and print the URL
 *   stop      signal its process group and forget it
 *
 * install is separate on purpose. The editor is a Vite dev server that lives in
 * the toolkit, not in the project: strip_editor/ ships inside the package, its
 * node_modules do not. Somebody has to fetch them -- but a `start` that decides
 * to download 200 MB while you wait for a window is a command you cannot
 * predict. So start checks, names the missing step, and exits.
 *
 * Background by default, because a dev server you have to keep a terminal open
 * for is not something `stop` can help with. The pid and process group land in
 * <workRoot>/.design-ss/editor.json -- the same trick `design-ss stop` uses for
 * a run, and the reason neither needs a daemon.
 *
 * The one thing this does NOT do is tell the editor where the project is. The
 * editor still resolves strips relative to its own parent directory (see
 * strip_editor/vite-plugin-editor-api.ts, REPO_ROOT), so it serves the
 * TOOLKIT's strips/, not the work root's. Start says which directory it is
 * serving and warns when that directory is empty, rather than presenting an
 * empty strip list as if the project had none. Fixing it properly is the
 * two-root change render.mjs and check-schema.mjs already went through.
